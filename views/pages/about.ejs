<p>
A Chrome extension for better education
</p>

<p>
This will be a system for allowing students to indicate their learning state very easily, and the teacher (and perhaps other students) to be able to see it.
</p>

<p>
The browser (Chrome) extension will simply allow the student to choose a colour - white (in the zone), red (struggling/need help) or green (too easy).
</p>

<p>
Via a different page/console, the teacher will be able to see a list of the students in their class, and their current state. Optionally, other students may be able to see student state as well, for example, for 'green' students to be able to find and assist 'red' students. This page might be implemented in a google sheet, or via a custom web app.
